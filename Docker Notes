Docker:
-------
To package and containarize applications. And to ship them anywhere and run readily.
Docker manages the containers(which runs apps,libs,dependencies)
Docker has less isolation as containers share same underlying resources(CPU, Memory, Disk)
Docker consumes less memory, disk space and boot time. so can scale huge no of continers in a short time.

Dockers images are stored in dockerhub or docker store from where we can download images and make them run
ex: Ansible image is pulbilcy available in dockerhub, we can download it to host machine.
    Install docker on your host machine and create a container for ansible by using below command.

   docker run asnible
   docker run mongodb
   
Images vs Containers:
--------------------
Images are packages or templates for an application
Images are used to create containers
'N' no of containers can be created from same image. Each container is isolated from other even if its build from same image.
Developer writes a docker file from which a docker image is built. Devops team creates docker container using the docker image

    docker file -----> docker image------> docker container




open -a Docker --> to start docker
docker ps ---> to list containers running
