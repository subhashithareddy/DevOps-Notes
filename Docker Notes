Docker:
-------
To package and containarize applications. And to ship them anywhere and run readily.
Docker manages the containers (which runs apps,libs,dependencies)
Docker has less isolation as containers share same underlying resources(CPU, Memory, Disk)


open -a Docker --> to start docker
docker ps ---> to list containers running
